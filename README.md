2. According to the type of text:

    - Survey/position: identify the problem/topic that is analysed, the analysis criteria, the methodology to analyse, interpretation of the analysis, conclusions

    - Proposal of a solution/system: problem statement, the principle of the solution, concrete results (system, model, algorithm), experimentation and assessment

3. Identify references that seem interesting and key in the text

4. Google the authors
